## Must Haves Before starting level
- [X] Sepolia ETH on MetaMask Wallet to be used.

```js
// start with player call variable, you get your wallet address
player
// proceed with 
getBalance(player)
//check ethernaut contract abi and owner
await ethernaut
//look for .owner()
await ethernaut.owner()
// Connect wallet and get instance , use the UI to interact

//Proceed by checking the contract
await contract

// Follow hints in sequence, keep following the trail
await contract.info()
await contract.info1()
await contract.info2("hello")
(await contract.infoNum()).toString()
await contract.info42()
await contract.theMethodName()
await contract.method7123949()

// Get password and authenticate
await contract.password()
await contract.authenticate("ethernaut0")
```
## Submit and Win LVL 0
- Click on the submit instance.
- Approve the transaction

### Personal Experience and tips

##### proceed always with   Chrome Browser , as firefox will fail likely on instance and transaction await calls on submission and instance allocation due to incorrect configuration with metamask sepolia network and rejects at usage.
##### Keep Plenty of Sepolia Eth, use second website shared for more tokens.
